Fixed a crash related to "Boxed delivery" job type.
Fixed a crash related to adding extra jobs that had assemblies in their list of standard parts.
Fixed a crash related to deleting an assembly from the stock list (using swipe gesture or "Edit stock list button").
Fixed a bug where assembled filters and units would not be shown on "Sign stock used" sheet.
Fixed a bug where the checks for empty stock lists were not working properly (one could end up entering a job with no stock used at all and the app would not generate a warning).
Fixed a bug where an app crash would lead to job cell being "ticked" upon the next app start.

Tubing upgrade jobs for franchisees will have default stock list pre-loaded (similar to filter change jobs). Plumbers would still have to select between "Option 1" and "Option 2" upgrades.
"Split payment" button on the payment screen has been hidden for now, we will rework the payment screen interface in a future update before putting it back.

======================================

1.4f -- Stock float, assemblies and part pictures

Stock "float" is now calculated (based on levels reported by the server whenever data exchange takes place) and reduced appropriately as jobs are done. To view stock float, switch to Summary tab, tap "Switch to stock", then tap "View stock float". Note that during the testing period your in-app float will be "replenished" to default levels daily. This is intended. Once we switch to new stock control system, float will be reported according to real data.
Assemblies are now used in lists of stock (filters and units that are assembled in the warehouse).
Part pictures are now contained within the app to reduce size of files exchanged with the server.

======================================

Franchisee manual has been updated: changes to SOP0008
New reference count extension has been implemented -- less memory consumption, crashes less likely
Rewritten the "Next" button click handler on Payment screen to get rid of crashes caused by subscripting twice to the click event using += operator

Known issues: when a job has been added to the cluster and warranty switch set to "ON", going back to selecting parts for this added job will result in warranty switch and pressure field not being displayed properly

1.4d -- Fixes

Ticks and crosses will now be displayed correctly for manually added jobs.
Data noise in phone fields will now be handled correctly when reading run data ("Nothing to see here, move along" message will no longer be displayed).

======================================

1.4b -- Manual jobs can be moved into the main list

Franchisee manual has been updated (SOP 003, section 7)
Manually created jobs can now be rearranged and placed into the main list (but not back). However, reloading the run by switching dates or using "Reset to default order button" will place them into their original section.

I love deposits, everyone loves deposits, they are expected to be working correctly now [for real this time].

======================================

1.3g -- Fixes for fixes

Fixed the fix for deposits bug deployed with 1.3f (it did not cover some of the scenarios).
Fixed the fix that prevents a pop-up saying "Data for some of the jobs has not been entered" from appearing incorrectly.
Updated test database file so it can be loaded without errors when database is missing for whatever reason. 

======================================

1.3f -- Deposits bug

Corrected an issue where deposits collected before an install job would be accounted for in filter change jobs.

======================================

1.3e -- Run routes calculation added

Implemented calculation of a run route using the longitude and latitude of customer addressess in the database. It leaves a lot to be desired, though, and will be iterated over in future.

======================================

1.3d -- Job order persists between app sessions

Re-ordering of the jobs is now persistent.
Fixed a bug related to highlighting customer records in payments summary when a job cell was selected (sometimes other customer records were highlighted along with the correct one).
Data exchange timeouts are more aggressive so that the interface responds faster.
Data exchange session does not hang when trying to establish connection.
App recovers much quicker from errors during data transfers. This means that consecutive data exchange attempts are much more likely to succeed.

======================================

1.3c -- Reworked data exchange code

Fixed signature field responding to touches before "Start signing" button was clicked.
Data exchange process has been reworked, speed and reliability have improved.

Fixed a crash related to using "Job not done" button.
Fixed a bug related to adding two jobs for the same customer when opening e-mails.

Jobs are now sorted differently (according to their time frames). It was not possible previously due to times being recorded in arbitrary form in plumbing comments. 

======================================

1.3a -- Interface changes for iOS 7

Navigation bars no longer overlap the status bar (clock and battery level stay visible).
Fonts in job table view have been made bigger and bolder.
Highlighting a job was not distinct enough, it is now blue again, resembling iOS 6 behavior.
App version is now visible on the main navigation bar.

======================================

1.3 -- Extra jobs through e-mails

This build supports iOS 7, it is now safe to update your iPad software to that version.

Extra job that are booked and done on the same day will now be e-mailed.
When such e-mail is received, open the message in Mail, download and click the attachment and select "Open in Puratap" option. Job data will be then added to your current run. This newly created entry will be marked in yellow (as if "Attention" flag has been set).
After the job has been added, a confirmation e-mail window will pop up. Fields will be pre-filled, you will only need to click the "Send" button.

======================================

1.2i -- Signature fix

Signature capturing has been completely overhauled. It is no longer bland and laggy when someone paints in the signature box for a while.

Known issues:
    The very first time a receipt PDF is generated for previewing, it will not display properly (a blank grey window is shown instead).

Fixed many interface elements overlapping each other in iOS 7.
Fixed a crash when creating a new memo on iPads running iOS 7.

Fixed a bug where removing company name from customer details screen would not update the database properly.
Fixed a bug during data transfer that led to an application crash. 

======================================

1.2d -- Minor stuff

The app did not communicate the data exchange result clearly. To remedy this, another section of the job run table has been added that displays the time of the last successful data download attempt. Also, if download fails, an alert will pop up to notify the user. 
 
There was an issue related to reading deposits data that sometimes threw off accounting and payment information. It has now been fixed.

There was an issue related to the filter change fee that would sometimes lead to incorrectly assigniing an old $13.23 fee for FC jobs. It will no longer happen.


======================================
1.2c -- HD upgrade fees fixed

Fixed a bug that led to app assigning $14.00 fee for HD tubing upgrades. It now assigns $15.42 as it should.

======================================
1.2b -- Invoice fees are no more

Fixed a regression crash caused by marking the first job after starting the app as "Not Done".
Invoice fees have not been an effective solution for debt bloat.

1.2a -- Deposits and Invoice fees

Deposits for installation jobs will now be properly recognized on iPad.
Sending an invoice to the customer will now incur an additional $ 5.00 fee. This is not to increase income but rather to prevent debts from growing (because a lot of invoices are paid overdue and some will not be paid at all).
The fees for some of the plumbing jobs were displaying incorrectly in the summary, this has been fixed.

1.2 -- Bugfixes

The checkboxes introduced in 1.1e were not implemented correctly and led to quite a few crashes. Clicking the checkbox right after finishing a job was crashing the app. This has been fixed.

========================================

A stock counting bug that was introduced in build 1.1 has been fixed.
========================================

1.1a -- Hotfix for signature issue

There was an issue with signature capturing in 1.1. It was not reproducible in the iPad simulator in development. Touches that went straight across the signature field from left to right would not be captured properly. This has been fixed.
Changed the background color of signature field to yellow.

========================================

1.1 -- Quality of life changes

Signing will no longer eventually crash the app. Thanks to everyone who has been poking me about this, sorry it took so long. (There was a memory leak when capturing signatures. It led to an eventual crash, sometimes at quite random times, and no crash logs were sent out. This has been fixed now.)
Pressing "Job not done" button will now display a large field to enter the comments. Thanks to Tony for suggesting this.
The parts list on the filter change screen will now be populated with standard parts by default. However, this means it will take half a second to display it.
On devices that are running iOS 5 there was a bug where device location updated far too frequently. This led to battery drain and has been fixed.
Geocoding data was missing data points when device was put to sleep and when app went into background. It is now much more reliable.

========================================1.0h -- Bug fixes

Added database integrity checks so that even if the database is corrupt, the app would still start and allow to try to receive the data from server again.
Simplified the threading code to get rid of random crashes.
If a phone number was removed completely, the app would crash upon trying to update it. This has been fixed.

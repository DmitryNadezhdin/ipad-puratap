2013-11-01  Dmitry Nadezhdin  <denadezhdin@gmail.com>

	* Reachability.cs: 1.3d: Reachability class is used to
	determine if starting data exchange with iPad data dispatcher
	server makes sense (checks if server IP address is reachable
	via WiFi or WWAN). It has replaced NetBrowser that was based
	on Apple's Bonjour SDK.

	* Root.plist: 1.3d: this defines Puratap app settings
	available in the iPad's Settings app

	* test.plist: Test

	* AppDelegate.cs: 1.3d: LoadRun() in JobRunTableSource now
	accepts int parameter instead of bool


	* ClientServerDataExchange.cs: 1.3d: data exchange code
	improved, TcpClient.EndConnect is now called in all cases
	(when connection fails, ThreadPool is tasked with calling
	EndConnect asynchronously), code cleaned up, legacy methods
	removed, timeouts on network sync read/write operations
	decreased from 100 seconds to 60, timeout on file transfer
	increased from 10 seconds to 30, updated log messages, removed
	NetBrowser object and dependancy on Bonjour (server IP and
	port are now stored in application settings on the iPad)


	* DetailedTabs.cs: 1.3d: job order is now saved into
	PL_RECOR.IPAD_ORDERING field in the database each time "Done"
	button is clicked after rearranging them. "Reset jobs to
	default order" button still resets the order. If PL_RECOR in
	the database does not have an IPAD_ORDERING field, integrity
	check will fail and data cannot be loaded since ReadRunData()
	method uses IPAD_ORDERING in ORDER BY clauses of its SQLs.

	* Info.plist:
	* ServerClient.xib: Updated to 1.3d

	* JobRunTable.cs: 1.3d: LoadJobRun() method now accepts int
	parameter instead of bool, ReadRunData() now uses
	IPAD_ORDERING field in SQL queries to have job cell order save
	between application sessions.

	* MyConstants.cs: 1.3d: now includes default values for iPad
	data dispatcher server (IP address and port).

	* NEWTESTDB.sqlite: 1.3d: altered PL_RECOR table to include
	IPAD_ORDERING field

	* PaymentsSummary.cs: 1.3d: fixed a bug where customer records
	were sometimes highlighted incorrectly in the payment summary

	* Puratap.csproj: Updated to 1.3d: includes Settings.bundle
	folder now that defines Puratap app settings

	* ServerClient.designer.cs: Updated to 1.3d: the old data
	exchange button is now hidden, some elements has shifted
	around and renamed


	* ServerClientViewController.cs: 1.3d: new implementation of
	data exchange process does away with Bonjour and uses default
	settings (NSUSerDefaults.StandardUserDefaults) to determine
	iPad data server IP and port. Reachability class is now used
	to determine if that IP is reachable via WiFi or WWAN
	(allowing to use 3G or 4G if iPad data dispatcher is run on an
	Internet server). A lot of legacy code commented out. Starting
	data exchange is now reported as a TestFlight checkpoint
	again.

	* SignDailyStockUsed.cs: Updated to 1.3d: fixed a bug where
	two navigation bars were visible and overlapped each other
	(one that belonged to ServerClientNavigationController, the
	other to DetailedTabs).
